# RowDictionary

This project is not intended to be a replace of a Dictionary

It doesn't implement IDictionary

To optimize read over write:

 * I would sort the list everytime add a new value or
 * Create a kind of hashtable using an Array of LinkedList.

I'll create an example project and add a few more test cases in a next release
